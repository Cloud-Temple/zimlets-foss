# zimlets-foss
All Zimlets from Zimbra FOSS source and some example server extensions and documentation.

You could dump Zimlets from Zimlet/src/zimlet/ in
/opt/zimbra/zimlets-deployed/_dev

Doing so you can find example code used in Zimlets that do stuff that is not (well) documented.

DO NOT INSTALL THESE ON A PRODUCTION SERVER, also you may wish to:
zmprov mcf zimbraHttpDosFilterMaxRequestsPerSec 10000


Extension examples are here:
ZimbraServer/examples/server-extensions/README.txt
